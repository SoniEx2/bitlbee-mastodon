Build dependencies
------------------
- bitlbee and headers >= 3.5
  If using distribution version of bitlbee you will need to install the dev
  package, usually bitlbee-dev or bitlbee-devel. If bitlbee was built from
  source don't forget to do `make install-dev`.

- glib2 and headers => 2.32
  The library itself is usually installed as a dependency of bitlbee, headers
  need to be installed separately. In Debian, the package containing them is
  libglib2.0-dev.

- autotools (if building from git)
  A bit of an overkill, but autotools is the build system of choice now, sorry.


Building and Installing
-----------------------
If building from git you will first need to generate autotools configuration
script and related files by executing the following command:

  $ ./autogen.sh

After that (or when building from a tarball) you can build as usual:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

If your bitlbee's plugindir is in non-standard location you can specify it by
calling ./configure with --with-plugindir=/path/to/plugindir option.

Usage
-----
Please refer to the help system:

  > help mastodon

Debugging
---------
You can enable extra debug output for bitlbee-mastodon, by setting BITLBEE_DEBUG
environment variable. This will enable bitlbee-mastodon to print all traffic it
exchanges with mastodon servers to stdout and there is a lot of it. To get it
on your screen run bitlbee by hand in foreground mode: 
  $ BITLBEE_DEBUG=1 bitlbee -nvD
then connect with an irc client as you usually do.

WARNING: there IS sensitive information in this debug output, such as auth
tokens, your plaintext password and, obviously, your incoming and outgoing
messages. Be sure to remove any information you are not willing to share before
posting it anywhere.

If you are experiencing crashes please refer to this page for information on
how to get a meaningful backtrace: https://wiki.bitlbee.org/DebuggingCrashes
